# WorldGroupTP
A Minecraft server plugin that organizes worlds into groups that you can teleport to. (e.g. SMP with Overworld, Nether and End)


------------

This plugin is currently used as an extension of the [WorldPos plugin my mike726](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldpos "WorldPos plugin my mike726"), but in the future I want to add support for other plugins that work in a similar way or to implement those features in this plugin so it can be used independently.

## Usage
- /createwg *<name*> - creates a worldgroup with the given name
- /addwg *<worldgroup*>*<world*> - add a world to the worldgroup
- /worldgrouptp *<player*>*<worldgroup*> - teleports the player to the last world he was in inside of the worldgroup.
